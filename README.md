The main objective of this course is to train analysts in data science, either for research or the labor market, using the latest techniques applied in machine learning.
1- using the resources of common computers, 
2-hybrid programming: using the resources of a normal computer and specific hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
3- distributed and cloud programming, for big cases, such as Big Data.


Parallel Programming
* Multiprocessor/Multicore Programming.
* Parallel Programming with Shared Memory (and the dangers for data)
* Parallel Programming with Shared Memory with traffic lights and locking

Hybrid Programming
* Use of GPUs and how they differ from ordinary computer processors.
* How GPUs are programmed: when and how they can be used.
* Use of advanced GPU programming techniques, and GPU resource management.
* How to use GPUs in Machine Learning.

Distributed Programming
* What is distributed computing and how can we take advantage of it?
* Use of distributed programming platforms for big data and Machine Learning.
* Use cases of Apache Spark for machine learning.
